Facial Expression Recognition (FER) identifies emotions from facial cues using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It classifies feelings like happiness, sadness, and anger.

The process begins with collecting labeled facial images, which vary in lighting and angles. Next, images are resized and normalized for better model learning.
A CNN architecture is built to extract features and make predictions. The model is trained on the labeled dataset, adjusting parameters to reduce errors.

Finally, the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision. FER can enhance human-computer interaction, assess mental health, and improve security systems by
understanding emotions in real time.
